As you are aware of the layering structure of the specification projects under Eclipse Dataspace Working group where protocols forms the basis for the data exchange while the profiles are making it possible by defining the requirements and schema definitions. It does not stop there, it further makes it possible to connect to trust frameworks, thereby enabling the participants to perform trusted data sharing.
